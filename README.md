Exploratory Data Analysis exercise 2

On this repository you will find the graphs and codes for solving the exercises from Exploratory Data Analysis eCourse, answering the folllowing questions:

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

Each plot and code correspond to the specific question (eg. Graph_1 and Graph_1_code correspond to the first question).
I've tryed to code everything on a easy-to-read coding and introduced as many notes as I believe would be necessary for someone to understand what I've done. I'm not a programmer, so I'll appreciate all the coments regarding optimization of my coding and suggestions to improve the readability. All the code was made assuming that you already have the data download and extracted on your working directory.
Thank you for your attention and kind review.

Regads,
